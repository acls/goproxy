slt is a dead-simple TLS reverse-proxy with SNI multiplexing (TLS virtual hosts).

That means you can send TLS/SSL connections for multiple different applications to the same port and forward
them all to the appropriate backend hosts depending on the intended destination.

# Features

### SNI Multiplexing
slt multiplexes connections to a single TLS port by inspecting the name in the SNI extension field of each connection.

### Simple YAML Configuration
You configure slt with a simple YAML configuration file:

```yaml
tls:
  secure: true
  bind_addr: :443

  frontends:
    v1.example.com:
      backends:
      - addr: :4443

    v2.example.com:
      backends:
      - addr: 192.168.0.2:443
      - addr: 192.168.0.1:443

http:
  secure: false
  bind_addr: :80

  frontends:
    test.example.com:
      backends:
      - addr: 192.168.1.1:443

name:
  secure: false
  bind_addr: :1234

  frontends:
    test.example.com:
      backends:
      - addr: 192.168.2.1:1234
```


### Optional TLS Termination
Sometimes, you don't actually want to terminate the TLS traffic, you just want to forward it elsewhere. slt only
terminates the TLS traffic if you specify a private key and certificate file like so:

```yaml
name:
  frontends:
    v1.example.com:
      tls_key: /path/to/v1.example.com.key
      tls_crt: /path/to/v1.example.com.crt
```


### Round robin load balancing among arbitrary backends
slt performs simple round-robin load balancing when more than one backend is available (other strategies will be available in the future):

```yaml
name:
  frontends:
    v1.example.com:
      backends:
      - addr: :8080
      - addr: :8081
```


# Running it
Running slt is also simple. It takes a single argument, the path to the configuration file:

    ./slt /path/to/config.yml


# Building it
Just cd into the directory and "go build". It requires Go 1.1+.

# Testing it
Just cd into the directory and "go test".
